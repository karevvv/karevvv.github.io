description: This is a short tutorial on how I set up this blog on Github Pages with Astro
---
I used to make my blog using the Jekyll Theme [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy). However I decided I wanted to switch things up and try out a new theme. After looking for a while, I finally found a theme that I like, ensribe's [astro-erudite](https://github.com/jktrn/astro-erudite). I mainly chose this theme cuz it has really cool features and I like the UI more. To checkout some of the features, I recommend checking the astro-erudite [blog](https://astro-erudite.vercel.app/)

I had a "How I set up this blog" blog for my chirpy blog (you could still find that blog post [here](https://karevvv.github.io/blog/how-i-set-up-this-blog-old/)) so I thought I should make another one for this one. I won't go into that much detail on how to install it as the [github repo](https://github.com/jktrn/astro-erudite) has already given that. Instead I'll mainly focus on the changes I made to the template.

I made some changes, mainly to the color theme. I really enjoy the catpuccin themes so I wanted it to be the main theme for my blog. However I hate frontend dev so I vibecoded the changes. I simply took the color pallete from Catppuccin's [website](https://catppuccin.com/palette/) and asked copilot to change the color theme. This astro theme allow both light and dark mode but since I never used light mode I didn't bother too much into making the light mode look good, sorry light mode enjoyers.

The next thing I changed is the syntax higlighthing. astro-erudite uses [Expressive code](https://expressive-code.com/) for code blocks and [rehype-pretty-code for](https://rehype-pretty.pages.dev/) inline code highlighting. Both plugin has builtin catpuccin theme. Here is the config that I changed to apply the catpuccin theme

```ts title="astro.config.ts" startLineNumber = 48 del={3,8,53,55} ins={4,9,54,56} collapse={10-49}
        rehypeExpressiveCode,
        {
          themes: ['github-light', 'github-dark'],
          themes: ['catppuccin-latte', 'catppuccin-mocha'],
          plugins: [pluginCollapsibleSections(), pluginLineNumbers()],
          useDarkModeMediaQuery: false,
          themeCssSelector: (theme: ExpressiveCodeTheme) =>
            `[data-theme="${theme.name.split('-')[1]}"]`,
            theme.name === 'catppuccin-mocha' ? '[data-theme="dark"]' : '[data-theme="light"]',
          defaultProps: {
            wrap: true,
            collapseStyle: 'collapsible-auto',
            overridesByLang: {
              'ansi,bat,bash,batch,cmd,console,powershell,ps,ps1,psd1,psm1,sh,shell,shellscript,shellsession,text,zsh':
                {
                  showLineNumbers: false,
                },
            },
          },
          styleOverrides: {
            codeFontSize: '0.75rem',
            borderColor: 'var(--border)',
            codeFontFamily: 'var(--font-mono)',
            codeBackground:
              'color-mix(in oklab, var(--muted) 25%, transparent)',
            frames: {
              editorActiveTabForeground: 'var(--muted-foreground)',
              editorActiveTabBackground:
                'color-mix(in oklab, var(--muted) 25%, transparent)',
              editorActiveTabIndicatorBottomColor: 'transparent',
              editorActiveTabIndicatorTopColor: 'transparent',
              editorTabBorderRadius: '0',
              editorTabBarBackground: 'transparent',
              editorTabBarBorderBottomColor: 'transparent',
              frameBoxShadowCssValue: 'none',
              terminalBackground:
                'color-mix(in oklab, var(--muted) 25%, transparent)',
              terminalTitlebarBackground: 'transparent',
              terminalTitlebarBorderBottomColor: 'transparent',
              terminalTitlebarForeground: 'var(--muted-foreground)',
            },
            lineNumbers: {
              foreground: 'var(--muted-foreground)',
            },
            uiFontFamily: 'var(--font-sans)',
          },
        },
      ],
      [
        rehypeShiki,
        {
          themes: {
            light: 'github-light',
            light: 'catppuccin-latte',
            dark: 'github-dark',
            dark: 'catppuccin-mocha',
          },
          inline: 'tailing-curly-colon',
        },
      ],
    ],
```

Another thing I changed is to add two sections on my homepage. For this change I also vibecoded it cause I am wayy too lazy. I also added a discord icon that links to my discord profile utilizing `simple-icons`. For that it is as easy as adding simple-icons to the `package.json` file and adding the following line of code

```ts startLineNumber=44 ins={8}
export const ICON_MAP: IconMap = {
  Website: 'lucide:globe',
  GitHub: 'lucide:github',
  LinkedIn: 'lucide:linkedin',
  Twitter: 'lucide:twitter',
  Email: 'lucide:mail',
  RSS: 'lucide:rss',
  Discord: 'simple-icons:discord',
}
```

Last but not least, I need to add a github workflow to push my changes into my github pages. Luckily I could simply yoink it from astro's [website](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/github/)

Thats pretty much all the changes I could remember. Yes ik a lot is vibecoded but I couldn't care enough to put in the time and effort to make those changes myself.
